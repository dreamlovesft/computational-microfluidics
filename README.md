# computational-microfluidics
Python script for computation of dinoflagellate bioluminescence

Employs [openCV](http://opencv.org/) (Open Source Computer Vision Library) to make sense of how many dinoflagellate organisms are passing through a microfluidics device, the speed, and how many of those dinoflagellates are flashing via bioluminescent reaction to applied shear stress on the cell walls.

Also some numpy just to tally counts up, etc.

Built for batch processing of thousands of low-res images, dump into input folder and extract from result folder.
